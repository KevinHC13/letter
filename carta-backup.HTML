				I’ve made my Naughty and Nice list, and I’ve checked it twice.  You are on my Nice List!  I am so happy that you have been such a good <select>
				<option value="1" selected>boy/girl</option>
				<option value="2">boy</option>
				<option value="3">girl</option>
				</select>  this year.  I heard from my secret messenger that you want <input type="text" value="" placeholder="What do they want for Christmas?" data-subline="For example: <em>a doll</em> or <em>some legos</em>"/> for Christmas this year.  Because you have been so good, the Elves and I have prepared a special present for you to open on Christmas Morning.
				<br />
				<br />

				Can you do me a favor?  I want you to try really hard to <input type="text" value="" placeholder="Insert something that the child needs to work on" data-subline="For example: <em>get better grades</em> or <em>be nice to your sibling</em>"/>.  If you can do that for me, then I will be very happy and might bring you an extra treat on Christmas Morning.
				<br />
				<br />

				By the time I get to your house in <input type="text" value="" placeholder="Insert the child's city" data-subline="For example: <em>Salt Lake City</em> or <em>London</em>"/>, I am going to be very hungry.  Would you leave some cookies and milk out for me?  Chocolate Chip cookies are my favorite, but I love all kinds of cookies!  Well I need to get back to my workshop and help the Elves. Keep up the good work <input type="text" value="" placeholder="Child's name" data-subline="For example: <em>Jane</em> or <em>John</em>"/> and have a Very Merry Christmas!

				Ho Ho Ho,
